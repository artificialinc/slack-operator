# slack-operator
Kubernetes operator for Slack

# TODO: 
 - Readme for slack app/token creation
 - Update to operator v1.0.0
 - CRD tests for deletion and users invite scenario
 - Webhooks
 - Scenario: rename to existing channel, then delete the CRD what will happen?: ID will be of the channel we want to delete so no issue?
